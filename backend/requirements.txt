# TaskFlowr Backend Dependencies
# ⚠️ INTENTIONALLY INSECURE: Many packages are unpinned or outdated
# TODO: Pin all versions and audit with pip-audit

# === SUPPLY CHAIN VULNERABILITIES (Educational Examples - Not Real Packages) ===
# Unicode homoglyph attack: Cyrillic 'е' instead of Latin 'e' in line below
# rеquests==2.31.0  # Malicious! Cyrillic е (U+0435) - would install fake package
# Fix: Use ASCII-only, check with: python -c "print([c for c in 'rеquests' if ord(c)>127])"

# ctop-internal-auth==1.2.3  # Dependency confusion - private pkg can be hijacked from PyPI
# logger-utils==1.0.5  # Installs malicious .pth file that runs on every Python import
# image-toolkit==3.1.2  # Different code in wheel vs source distribution
# flask-monitoring==1.2.3  # Conditional payload - detects sandbox vs production, runs clean in CI

# Typosquatting examples (DO NOT UNCOMMENT - malicious packages!):
# requets==2.31.0  # Missing 's' - logs all HTTP requests
# urlib3==1.26.0   # Missing 'l' - URL hijacking
# cyptography==41.0  # Missing 'r' - crypto key theft

Flask==3.0.0
# Updated for Python 3.12+ compatibility (pkgutil.get_loader removed)
# Still INTENTIONALLY INSECURE: Will be configured with DEBUG=True

flask-cors==4.0.0
# Updated for compatibility
# INTENTIONALLY INSECURE: Will be configured with allow_origins="*"

PyJWT==2.4.0
# INTENTIONALLY INSECURE: Older version

SQLAlchemy
# INTENTIONALLY INSECURE: Unpinned version

Werkzeug==3.0.0
# Updated for Python 3.12+ compatibility

python-dotenv

# PyYAML vulnerability demo - participants will fix unsafe yaml.load() usage in code
# pyyaml - Install fails on this system, see VULNERABILITY_DETAILS.md for yaml.load() RCE demo
urllib3==1.26.5  # CVE-2021-33503 - header injection

# Environment marker attack - different packages per platform
# data-processor==2.1.0; sys_platform == "linux"  # Safe on Linux
# data-processor-optimized==2.1.0; sys_platform == "win32"  # Malicious on Windows!

# Transitive dependency vulnerability (3 levels deep)
# pymongo 3.12.0 -> dnspython 2.1.0 -> idna 2.10 (CVE-2021-29921 RCE!)
